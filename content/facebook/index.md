Newstead Road Pre-School now has a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/289738737816736/)
for the parents and carers of children who attend, helping you to stay up-to-date with news from the pre-school.

We will use it alongside the current methods of communication to send
reminders about special events and [term dates](/term_dates) and also to let you know what your
children are up to at the pre-school!

We have to be careful of course about privacy
and security of our children, so it will be a closed group (meaning only group members
will be able to see the Group's posts) and we won't be putting up photos or names.

We hope you will join the Group and find it helpful and effective way of keeping
informed about goings on at Newstead Road pre-school. The administrator is
Samantha Sharp (a member of the [parents committee](/trustees/)), who will approve everyone wishing to join the Group.

If you would like to join please
search for 'Newstead Road Preschool' in Facebook and click 'join group'.

Let us know if you have any questions!

## Group Rules ##

Facebook group members will have to abide by the following rules:

* We have to be careful about the security and privacy of our children
so no photos are allowed on the Group, nor full names of children.

* If you have a question for [staff](/staff/) we request that you contact them by [telephone](tel:+442088579500), e-mail, or in person, at
the pre-school, rather than using this Group.

* Only messages relating to the pre-school
can be put on the group.

* Posters must be polite and respectful of all other members.

* Any posts which do not follow these rules will be taken down and members who
fail to follow the rules will be removed from the Group.

Thank you!
