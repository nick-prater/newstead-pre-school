> I am glad to be able to let you know that [child] has had a good first
> week at Blackheath High... She has been happy to attempt new things and asked me to help her come
> down the "fireman's pole" in our playground, when she saw another girl
> doing this.  She is able to manage her own coat (unlike most of the
> others!!) and has been quick to learn our routines...
> So thank you for your input in doing all the hard work before she came to
> us!  I hope we can keep up the good work.
