title: Becoming a trustee
---
Some trustees are parents of children attending our pre-school. Others are interested supporters of our work. This page is intended to provide information for anybody wishing to become a trustee of Newstead Road Pre-School.

At present, Newstead Pre-School is made up of two separate charities, as we are in the process of conversion from Unincorporated Association to Charitable Incorporated Organisation. You will become a trustee of both organisations.

The Charity Commission provide a good overview of the [role of a trustee](https://www.gov.uk/charity-trustee-whats-involved).

Before becoming a trustee, you will be asked to sign a [Declaration of Eligibility Form](/trustees/20150121-Trustee_Declaration.pdf).

Once completed, we can help you to:

* Update The Charity Commission with details of your appointment, for both of our charities.
* Notify Ofsted of your appointment via their web site.
* Complete the online Disclosure and Barring Service check (formerly CRB check) required by Ofsted.
* Ensure you name, address and contact details are on file in the office - this is a requirement of our Ofsted registration.
* Update the list of trustees on the pre-school web site.

## Further Information ##

You may also like to look at the much more detailed information provided by the Charity Commission on the [Trustee Role](https://www.gov.uk/running-charity/trustee-role-board). But please don't be put off by the amount of information there - there's a lot to read and not all of it is relevant!

We have a [PSLA](https://www.pre-school.org.uk/) book [Charity Essentials](https://shop.pre-school.org.uk/A122/charity-essentials) available to borrow in the office. This provides trustees with guidance on their roles and responsibilities, and offers advice to help with the effective operations of the charity.

Through the PSLA, we have access to a number of [online courses](http://pre-school.educare.co.uk/) covering different aspects of the pre-school, including safeguarding, budgeting and the role of trustees.
