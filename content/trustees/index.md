Newstead Road Pre-school is run by a voluntary management committee of trustees.

The trustees have overall responsibility for childcare at the pre-school, though they employ staff,
including a [manager](/staff/pat_mcgowan.html), to look after it's day-to-day operation.

The trustees committee are responsible for:

* financial management of the pre-school
* employment and appraisal of staff
* reviewing and maintaining policies
* ensuring the pre-school meets the requirements of the _Early Years Register_ and the _Childcare Register_

The present trustees are all parents of children who are attending or have attended the pre-school:

* [Nick Prater](/trustees/nick_prater.html)
* Barbara Maggs
* Ruth Hollick
* Dave Sapsford

We would be glad to hear from any parents or carers who are interested in becoming a trustee of the pre-school.

Trustees are elected by parents and carers of children attending the pre-school. Changes to trustees are 
[notified to Ofsted](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/childcare-registration-form-declaration-and-consent-form-for-all-individuals-connected-registered-pr)
, which includes vetting by the [Disclosure and Barring Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about).
They must also meet the Charity Commission's [eligibility requirements](http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/publications/cc30.aspx#6).
