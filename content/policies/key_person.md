title: The role of the key person and settling-in
---

# Policy statement #

We believe that children settle best when they have a key person to relate to, who knows them 
and their parents well, and who can meet their individual needs.

Research shows that a key 
person approach benefits the child, the parents, the staff and the pre-school by providing 
secure relationships in which children thrive, parents have confidence, staff are committed 
and the setting is a happy and dedicated place to attend or work in.

We want children to feel safe, stimulated and happy in the setting and to feel secure and 
comfortable with staff. We also want parents to have confidence in both their children's 
well-being and their role as active partners with the setting.

We aim to make the setting a welcoming place where children settle quickly and easily 
because consideration has been given to the individual needs and circumstances of children 
and their families.

The key person role is set out in the [Safeguarding and Welfare Requirements](http://www.foundationyears.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/EYFS-Statutory-Framework-2012.pdf)
of the Early Years Foundation Stage which says that we must assign a key person for each child.

These procedures set out a model for developing a key person approach that promotes effective 
and positive relationships for children who are in settings.


# Procedures #

* We allocate a key person before the child starts.

* Where a home visit is carried out before the child starts, this is done by the manager and the key person.

* The key person is responsible for the induction of the family and for settling the child into our setting.

* The key person offers unconditional regard for the child and is non-judgemental.

* The key person works with the parents to plan and deliver a personalised plan for the child's well-being, care and learning.

* The key person acts as the key contact for the parents and has links with other carers involved with the child, 
such as a childminder, and co-ordinates the sharing of appropriate information about the child's development with those carers.

* The key person is responsible for developmental records and for sharing information on a regular basis with the child's 
parents to keep those records up-to-date, reflecting the full picture of the child in our setting and at home.

* The key person encourages positive relationships between children in their key group, spending time with them as a group each day.

* We promote the role of the key person as the child's primary carer in our setting, and as the 
basis for establishing relationships with other staff and children.


# Settling-in #

* Before a child starts to attend the setting, we provide their parents with information in a variety of ways, including
our web site, written information, displays within the setting, information days and individual meetings with parents.

* We provide opportunities for the child and their parents to visit the setting.

* We allocate a key person to each child and their family before they start to attend.

* Their key person welcomes and looks after the child and his/her parents at the child's first session and during the settling-in process.

* We may offer a home visit by the person who will be the child's key person, to ensure all relevant information about the child can be made known.

* We use pre-start visits and the first session at which a child attends to explain and complete, with his/her parents, the child's registration records.

* When a child starts to attend, we explain the process of settling-in with his/her parents 
and jointly decide on the best way to help the child to settle into the setting.

* We have an expectation that the parent, carer or close relative, will stay for most of the first sessions,
gradually taking time away from their child and increasing this as and when the child is able to cope.

* Younger children will take longer to settle in, as will children who have not previously spent time 
away from home. Children who have had a period of absence may also need their parent to be on hand to re-settle them.

* We judge a child to be settled when they have formed a relationship with their key person; 
for example, the child looks for the key person when he/she arrives, goes to them for comfort, 
and seems pleased to be with them. The child is also familiar with where things are and is pleased 
to see other children and participate in activities.

* When parents leave, we ask them to say goodbye to their child and explain that they will be coming back, and when.

* We recognise that some children will settle more readily than others, but that some children who appear 
to settle rapidly are not ready to be left. We expect that the parent will honour the commitment to stay 
until their child can stay happily without them.

* We do not believe that leaving a child to cry will help them to settle any quicker. We believe that a 
child's distress will prevent them from learning and gaining the best from the setting.

* We reserve the right not to accept a child into the setting without a parent or carer if the child 
finds it distressing to be left. This is especially the case with very young children.

* Within the first four to six weeks of starting, we discuss and work with the child's parents to 
begin to create their child's record of achievement.


# The progress check at age two #

* The key person carries out the progress check at age two in accordance with any local procedures 
that are in place and referring to the guidance [A Know How Guide: The EYFS progress check at age two](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-know-how-guide-the-eyfs-progress-check-at-age-two).

* The progress check aims to review the child's development and ensures that parents 
have a clear picture of their child's development.

* Within the progress check, the key person will note areas where the child is progressing well and 
identify areas where progress is less than expected.

* The progress check will describe the actions that will be taken by the setting to address any 
developmental concerns (including working with other professionals where appropriate) as agreed with the parent(s).

* The key person will plan activities to meet the child's needs within the setting and will 
support parents to understand the child's needs in order to enhance their development at home.
