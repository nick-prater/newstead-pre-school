# Policy statement #
Children's safety is our highest priority at all times, both on and off the premises. Every attempt 
is made to ensure the security of the children is maintained at all times. In the unlikely event 
of a child going missing, our missing child procedure is followed.

# Procedures #

## Child goes missing on the premises ##

* As soon as it is noticed that a child is missing, their key person alerts the setting leader.

* Setting leader calls the police and reports the child as missing, then calls the parent.

* The setting leader carries out a thorough search of the building and outdoor space.

* The register is checked to make sure no other child has also gone astray.

* Doors and gates are checked to see if there has been a breach of security whereby a child could wander out.

* The setting leader talks to the staff to find out when and where the child was last seen and records this.

* The setting leader contacts the chair of the trustees committee and reports the incident. The chairperson comes 
to the setting immediately to carry out an investigation.

## Child goes missing on an outing ##
This describes what to do when staff have taken a small group on an outing, leaving the setting leader and/or other staff back in the setting. If the setting leader has accompanied children on the outing, the procedures are adjusted accordingly.

What to do when a child goes missing from a whole setting outing may be a little different, as parents usually attend and are responsible for their own child.

* As soon as it is noticed that a child is missing, staff on the outing ask children to stand with their designated carer and carry out a headcount to ensure that no other child has gone astray. One staff member searches the immediate vicinity, but does not search beyond that.

* The setting leader is contacted immediately and, if they are not on the outing, the incident is recorded.

* The setting leader contacts the police and reports the child as missing.

* The setting leader contacts the parent, who makes their way to the setting.

* Staff takes the remaining children back to the setting.

* In an indoor venue, staff will contact the venue's security who will then handle the search and contact the police if the child is not found.

* The setting leader contacts the chair of trustees and reports the incident. The chairperson comes to the setting immediately to carry out an investigation.

* A staff member may be advised by the police to stay at the venue until they arrive.

## The investigation ##
* Staff keep calm and do not let the other children become anxious or worried.

* The setting leader together with the chairperson or representative from the management committee speaks with the parent(s) or carer.

* The chair, director or owner, carry out a full investigation taking written statements from all the staff in the room or who were on the outing.

* The child's key person writes an incident report detailing:

    * The date and time of the report.
    * Which staff and children were in the group or outing and the name of the staff designated as responsible for the missing child.
    * When the child was last seen in the group or outing.
    * What had taken place in the group or outing since the child went missing.
    * The estimated time that the child went missing.
    * A conclusion is drawn as to how the breach of security happened.

* If the incident warrants a police investigation, all staff co-operate fully. In this case, the police 
will handle all aspects of the investigation, including interviewing staff. Children's Social Care may be 
involved if it seems likely that there is a child protection issue to address.

* The incident is reported under [RIDDOR](http://www.hse.gov.uk/riddor/) arrangements (see the Reporting of Accidents and Incidents policy). The 
local authority Health and Safety Officer may want to investigate and will decide if there is a case for prosecution.

* In the event of disciplinary action needing to be taken, Ofsted is informed.

* The insurance provider is informed.

## Managing people ##
* Missing children incidents are very worrying for all concerned. Part of managing the incident is to try to keep everyone as calm as possible.

* The staff will feel worried about the child, especially the key person or the designated carer responsible for the safety of that child for the outing. They may blame themselves and their feelings of anxiety and distress will rise as the length of time the child is missing increases.

* Staff may be the understandable target of parent anger and they may be afraid. Setting leaders need to ensure that staff under investigation are not only fairly treated but receive support whilst feeling vulnerable.

* Parents and carers may feel angry, and fraught. They may want to blame staff and may single out one staff member over others. They may direct their anger at the setting leader. When dealing with a distraught and angry parent, there should always be two members of staff, one of whom is the setting leader and the other should be the chairperson of the trustees committee. No matter how understandable the parent's anger may be, aggression or threats against staff are not tolerated, and the police should be called if assistance is needed.

* The other children are also sensitive to what is going on around them. They too may be worried. The remaining staff caring for them need to be focused on their needs and must not discuss the incident in front of them. They should answer the children's questions honestly but also reassure them.

* In accordance with the severity of the final outcome, staff may need counselling and support. If a child is not found, or is injured, or worse, this will be a very difficult time. The chairperson will use their discretion to decide what action to take.

* Staff must not discuss any missing child incident with the press without taking advice.
