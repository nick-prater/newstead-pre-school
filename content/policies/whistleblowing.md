title: Whistle Blowing Policy

# Policy Statement #

Staff working at Newstead Road Pre-school should feel confident about coming forward 
to report any issues or concerns that they may have and be protected from any subsequent 
discrimination.

Aim

Ensure staff understand their responsibilities and feel confident in raising and reporting a serious concern at the earliest opportunity  
Provide avenues for staff to raise concerns and receive feedback on any action taken

Ensure that staff receive a response to their concerns and that they are aware of how to pursue them if they are not satisfied

Reassure staff that they will be protected from possible reprisals or victimisation if they have made any disclosures in good faith

Any concerns can be reported without this leading to any harassment or victimisation, and 
every effort will be made to keep both the concern and the member of staff's identity confidential

# What should be reported? #

* Inappropriate treatment or care of a child
* Inappropriate behaviour by an adult in the setting, including that of manager, staff, trustees, students or volunteers
* Discrimination of any kind
* Concerns that could impact on the health and safety of the children or adults

Methods

A concern should be initially raised by any staff member to their line manager or a member of the trustees committee.
Discuss the nature of the concern together with the background, history of the concern and provide the relevant dates of incidents.
There is no expectation that staff prove beyond doubt the truth of their suspicion; however they will need to demonstrate that they are acting in good faith and there are reasonable grounds for their concern.         
All employees will be treated fairly.
Concerns will be dealt with in the following way:

Initial enquiries will be made to decide whether an investigation is appropriate and if so what form it should take. 
The incident will be investigated by the line manager and/or Committee member and/or Ofsted Lead
If appropriate it will be referred and put through established Safeguarding children procedures and may form the subject of an independent inquiry

Within ten working days of a concern being raised, the member of staff will receive in writing:

* Acknowledgment that the concern has been received
* An indication as to how the pre-school will deal with the matter
* Supply the member of staff with information on staff support mechanisms
* Inform the member of staff concerned as to whether any further investigation will take place and if not, why not.
* It may be necessary for the pre-school to interview staff to ensure that their disclosure is fully understood. Any meeting can be arranged away from the workplace, if so wished, and a representative or a friend may accompany the involved member of staff for support.

If there are any difficulties experienced as a result of raising a concern, support will be offered.

Staff will be kept informed, of the progress and outcome of any investigation to assure that any disclosure has been properly addressed unless legal reasons determine otherwise

Confidentiality . will be maintained and every effort will be made not to reveal a member of staff.s identity if they so wish. If however a member of staff makes an allegation frivolously maliciously or for personal gain, appropriate action, that could include disciplinary action, may be taken.

The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 seeks to protect employees from discrimination as a result of .blowing the whistle. on their organisation, or individuals within it, through amendments to employment law.
