# Policy statement #
We promote the good health of children, staff, parents and volunteers attending the pre-school.
We take steps to prevent cross-infection of viruses and bacterial infections
and to identify any allergies and prevent contact with the allergenic substance.

# Procedures for children who are sick or infectious #
* If a child appears unwell during the day (for example, they have a temperature, sickness, diarrhoea or pains,
particularly in the head or stomach), the pre-school manager calls the parents and asks them to collect the
child, or send a known carer to collect on their behalf.

* If a child has a temperature, they are kept cool, by removing top clothing and sponging their heads with
cool water, but kept away from draughts. The aim is to cool down their body's core temperature. (A draught can
excessively cool the extremities, causing the body to conserve heat at it's core.)

* The child's temperature is taken using a forehead thermometer strip kept in the first aid box.

* In extreme cases of emergency the child should be taken to the nearest hospital and the parent
informed.

* Parents are asked to take their child to the doctor before returning them to the pre-school. The pre-school can
refuse admittance to children who have a temperature, sickness and diarrhoea or a contagious
infection or disease.

* Where children have been prescribed antibiotics, parents are asked to keep them at home for 48
hours before returning to the setting, allowing time for the medication to take effect and in case there
is an adverse reaction.

* After diarrhoea, parents are asked to keep children home for 48 hours or until a formed stool is
passed.

* The setting has a [list of excludable diseases and current exclusion times](www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1194947358374).
This includes common childhood diseases such as chickenpox.

# Reporting of _notifiable diseases_ #
* If a child or adult is diagnosed suffering from a 
[notifiable disease](http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/NotificationsOfInfectiousDiseases/ListOfNotifiableDiseases/) 
under the [Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1988/1546/contents/made), the GP 
will report this to [Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england).

* When the setting becomes aware, or is formally informed of the [notifiable disease](http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/NotificationsOfInfectiousDiseases/ListOfNotifiableDiseases/), the manager
informs Ofsted and acts on any advice given by [Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england).

* The [Health Protection Agency](http://www.hpa.org.uk/) (now part of Public Health England) has a [list of notifiable diseases](http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/NotificationsOfInfectiousDiseases/ListOfNotifiableDiseases/).

# HIV/AIDS/Hepatitis procedure #
* [HIV](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/HIV/Pages/Introduction.aspx) and [Hepatitis](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hepatitis/pages/introduction.aspx), 
like other viruses, are spread through body fluids. Hygiene
precautions for dealing with body fluids are the same for all children and adults.

* Single use vinyl gloves and aprons are worn when changing children’s nappies, pants and clothing
which are soiled with blood, urine, faeces or vomit.

* Protective rubber gloves are used for cleaning/sluicing clothing after changing.

* Soiled clothing is bagged for parents to collect at the end of the session.

* Spills of blood, urine, faeces or vomit are cleared using mild disinfectant solution and mops. Any cloths
used are disposed of.

* Tables and other furniture, furnishings or toys affected by blood, urine, faeces or vomit are cleaned
using a disinfectant.

# Nits and head lice #
* [Nits and head lice](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/head-lice/Pages/Introduction.aspx) are not an excludable 
condition, although in exceptional cases a parent may be
asked to keep the child away until the infestation has cleared.

* On identifying cases of head lice, all parents are informed and asked to treat their child and all their
family if they are found to have head lice.


# Procedures for children with allergies #

* When parents start their children at the setting they are asked if their child suffers from any known
allergies. This is recorded on the registration form.

* If a child has an allergy, a risk assessment is completed to detail the following:

    * The allergen (i.e. the substance, material or living creature the child is allergic to such as nuts,
eggs, bee stings, cats etc).
    * The nature of the allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic shock reaction, including rash, reddening of
skin, swelling, breathing problems etc.).
    * What to do in case of allergic reactions, any medication used and how it is to be used (e.g.
[antihistamines](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antihistamines/Pages/Introduction.aspx), or adrenaline injections).
    * Control measures – such as how the child can be prevented from contact with the allergen.
    * Review timescale.

* This risk assessment is kept in the child’s personal file.

* A copy of the risk assessment is displayed in the kitchen, where staff can see it.

* The child's parents train staff in how to administer special medication in the event of an allergic reaction.

* If a child with a nut allergy is attending the setting, other parents, carers, staff and volunteers are made aware 
and asked to ensure that no nuts or nut products are brought in to the setting, for example in a packed lunch. We will
aim to ensure the pre-school is a nut-free environment, while recognising that this cannot be guaranteed.

* We aim to reduce the risk to children and adults who are susceptible to a severe allergic reaction, while at the same time
helping them to take responsibility as to what foods they can eat and to be aware of where they may be put at risk.

# Other considerations #
At all times the administration of medication must be compliant with the safeguarding and
welfare Requirements of the [Early Years Foundation Stage](http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/curriculum/a0068102/early-years-foundation-stage-eyfs),
follow procedures based on advice given in 
[Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings (DfES 2005)](http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupport/pastoralcare/b0013771/managing-medicines/managing-medicines-in-schools)
and be in accordance with the pre-school's [Administering Medicines policy](/policies/administering_medicines.html)
