# Policy statement #

* We promote children's right to be _strong, resilient and listened to_ by:

    * creating an environment in 
our pre-school that encourages children to develop a positive self-image, which includes their 
heritage, ethnicity, languages spoken at home, religious beliefs, cultural traditions and background.

    * encouraging children to develop a sense of autonomy and independence.

    * enabling children to have the self-confidence and vocabulary to resist inappropriate approaches.

* We help children to establish and sustain satisfying relationships within their families, with 
peers, and with other adults.

* We work with parents to build their understanding of, and commitment to, the principles of 
safeguarding all our children.
