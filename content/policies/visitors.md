# Policy Statement #

We aim to maintain a high level of safety and comfort for children at Newstead Road Pre-school. When receiving visitors we aim to protect the security and safety of children and adults and to minimise any disruption.

# Procedures #

* Visitors must sign the visitors book with the date, their name, time of arrival and departure and the purpose of visit.
* All visitors must show identification.
* The identity of any unknown or unannounced visitors must be checked before they are permitted to enter the setting.
* Visitors must be supervised by a member of staff or a trustee at all times.
* No visitor will be left alone with the children at any time.
* Where possible, visits should be made by appointment in advance, giving the staff the opportunity to prepare.
* Prospective children and parents are welcome and encouraged to visit the pre-school prior to joining.
* The pre-school has the right to refuse entry, or to ask a visitor to leave the pre-school. We will do so if we are unsure of the reason for their visit.
