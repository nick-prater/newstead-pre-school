We are committed to enabling _looked after_ children in our care to achieve and 
reach their full potential.

We recognise that children who are being looked after have often experienced traumatic situations:
physical, emotional or sexual abuse or neglect. However, we also recognise that not all looked after 
children have experienced abuse and that there are a range of reasons for children to be taken into the 
care of the local authority. Whatever the reason, a child's separation from their home and family signifies 
a disruption in their lives that has impact on their emotional well-being.

In our setting, we place emphasis on promoting 
[children's right to be strong, resilient and listened to](/policies/child_rights_and_entitlements.html).
Our policy and practice guidelines for looked after children are based on two important concepts: 
attachment and resilience. We aim to promote secure attachments in children's lives as the 
foundation for resilience. 

These aspects of well-being underpin a child's responsiveness to learning. For young children to get the most out of 
educational opportunities they need to be settled enough with their carer to be able to cope with further 
separation, a new environment and the new expectations made upon them.


# Definition of _Looked after Children_ (LAC) #
Children and young people become _looked after_ if they have 
either been taken into care by the local authority, or have been accommodated by the local authority (a 
voluntary care arrangement). Most LAC will be living in foster homes, but a smaller number may be in a 
children's home, living with a relative or even placed back home with their natural parent(s).

# Principles #
* The term _looked after child_ denotes a child's current legal status. This term is never used to 
categorise a child as standing out from others. We do not refer to such a child using acronyms such 
as LAC.

* We offer places to two-year-old children who are in care only in exceptional circumstances. In such cases, 
the child should show signs of having formed a secure attachment to the carer and the
placement in the setting should last a minimum of three months. However we will work closely with foster 
carers to ensure that the needs of two-year-old children are met and if the foster carer believes 
(based upon knowledge of the child) that attending our setting is in the 
child's best interest, we will gather as much information as possible and offer a place if appropriate.

* We offer places for funded three and four-year-olds who are in care to ensure they receive their 
entitlement to early education. We generally expect that a child will have formed a secure attachment to the 
carer, that the placement in the setting will last a minimum of six weeks and that the child will have been with their
foster carer for a minimum of one month. However we appreciate that not all placements can be this predictable 
for a foster carer and we will act in the best interest of the child.

* We will always offer _stay and play_ provision for a child who is two to five years old who is still 
settling with their foster carer, or who is only temporarily being looked after.

* Where a child who normally attends our setting is taken into care and is cared for by a local foster 
carer we will continue to offer a place for the child.


# Procedures 

* Every child is allocated a key person before they start and this is no different for a looked after child.

* The designated person for looked after children is the designated Child Protection co-ordinator, Pat McGowan,
who will ensure that the key person has the information, support and training necessary to meet the looked after child's needs.

* The designated person and the key person will liaise with agencies, professionals and practitioners involved 
with the child and their family, ensuring that appropriate information is gained and shared.

* The setting recognises the role of the local authority social care department as the child's _corporate 
parent_ and the key agency in determining what takes place with the child. Nothing changes, 
especially with regard to the birth parent's or foster carer's role in relation to the setting without prior 
discussion and agreement with the child's social worker.

* At the start of a placement with our setting, the designated person and child's allocated key person will meet with the 
foster carer and any other appropriate professionals involved in the child's life, to draw up a care plan
incorporating the child's learning needs and to enable the child to settle as quickly as possible.

* When planning for the child, the key person needs to consider such issues for the child as:

    * the child's emotional needs and how they are to be met
    * how any emotional issues and problems that affect behaviour are to be managed
    * the child's sense of self, culture, language and identity and how this is to be supported
    * the child's need for sociability and friendship
    * the child's interests, abilities and possible learning journey pathway
    * how any special needs will be supported
    * how information will be shared with the foster carer and local authority (as the corporate parent) 
    * what information is shared, with whom, and how it will be recorded and stored
    * what contact the child has with their birth parent(s) and what arrangements will be in place for 
supervised contact. If this is to be at the setting, when, where and what form the contact will take 
must be discussed and agreed.
    * what written reporting is required;
    * wherever possible the birth parent(s) should be involved in planning
    * with the social worker's agreement, the birth 
parent(s) should be involved in pre-school activities that include parents, such as outings and fundays, alongside the foster carer.

* The settling-in process for the child is agreed. It should be the same as for any other child, with the 
foster carer taking the place of the parent, unless otherwise agreed. It is even more important that 
the _proximity_ stage is followed until the child has visibly formed a relationship with his or her 
key person, sufficient to act as a _secure base_ to allow gradual separation from the foster carer. 
This process may take longer in some cases, so time needs to be allowed for it to happen without 
causing further distress or anxiety to the child.

* In the first two weeks after settling-in, the child's well-being is the focus of observation: their 
sociability and their ability to manage their feelings with or without support.

* Further observations about communication, interests and abilities will be noted to form a picture of the 
whole child in relation to the Early Years Foundation Stage Prime and Specific areas of learning.

* Concerns about the child will be noted in the child's file and discussed with the foster carer.

* If the concerns are about the foster carer's treatment of the child, or if abuse is suspected, these are 
recorded onto Child Protection Record and reported to the child's social care worker according to the 
setting's safeguarding children procedure.

* Regular contact should be maintained with the social worker through planned meetings that will 
include the foster carer. These will normally be arranged via the foster carer.

* Transition to school will be handled sensitively. The designated person or the child's key 
person will liaise with the school, passing on relevant information and documentation with the 
agreement of the looked after child's birth parents.
