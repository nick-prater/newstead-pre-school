# Policy statement #
In the event that a child is not collected by an authorised adult at the end of a session, we put into
practice agreed procedures. These ensure the child is cared for safely by an experienced and qualified
practitioner who is known to the child. The child will receive a high standard of care in order to cause as little
distress as possible.

We inform parents/carers of our procedures so that, if they are unavoidably delayed, they will be reassured
that their children will be properly cared for.

# Procedures #

* Parents of children starting at the setting are asked to provide the following specific information which is
recorded on our Registration Form:

    * Home address and telephone number. If the parents do not have a telephone, an alternative
number must be given, perhaps a neighbour or close relative.
    * Place of work, address and telephone number, if applicable.
    * Mobile telephone number, if applicable.
    * Names, addresses, telephone numbers and signatures of adults who are authorised by the parents
to collect their child from the setting, for example a childminder or grandparent.
    * Who has parental responsibility for the child.
    * Information about any person who does not have legal access to the child.

* On occasions when parents are aware that they will not be at home or in their usual place of work, they
inform us of how they can be contacted.

* On occasions when parents or the persons normally authorised to collect the child are not able to collect
the child, they provide us with written details of the name, address and telephone number of the person
who will be collecting their child. We agree with parents how to verify the identity of the person who is to
collect their child.

* Parents are informed that if they are not able to collect the child as planned, they must inform us so that
we can begin to take back-up measures. We provide parents with our contact telephone number.

* We inform parents that we apply our child protection procedures in the event that their children are not
collected from setting by an authorised adult within one hour after the setting has closed and the staff
can no longer supervise the child on our premises.

* If a child is not collected at the end of a session, we follow the following procedures:

    * The child’s file is checked for any information about changes to the normal collection routines.
    * If no information is available, parents/carers are contacted at home or at work.
    * If this is unsuccessful, the adults who are authorised by the parents to collect their child from the
setting – and whose telephone numbers are recorded on the Registration Form – are contacted.
    * All reasonable attempts are made to contact the parents or nominated carers.
    * The child will not leave the premises with anyone other than those named on the Registration Form or in their file.

## If nobody can be contacted to collect the child ##
If no-one collects the child after the setting has closed and there is no-one who can be contacted to
collect the child, we apply the procedures for uncollected children:

* We contact the [Lewisham Children's Social Care](http://www.lewisham.gov.uk/myservices/socialcare/children/Pages/default.aspx) team:

    * Duty Team: 020 8314 6660
    * Out-of-hours: 020 8314 6000

* The child will stay at the setting in the care of two fully-vetted workers until the child is safely
collected either by the parents or by a social care worker.

* The Social Care team will aim to find the parent or relative. If they are unable to do so, the child will become
looked after by the local authority.

* Under no circumstances will staff go to look for the parent, nor do they take the child home with
them.

## Follow-up ##
* A full written report of the incident will be recorded in the pre-school's Incident File.

* The pre-school reserves the right to charge parents/carers for the additional hours worked by
our staff.

* Our [local Pre-School Learning Alliance office](https://www.pre-school.org.uk/lewisham/) and [Ofsted](www.ofsted.gov.uk) may be informed of the incident.
