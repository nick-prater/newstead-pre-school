# Policy Statement #

We ensure that our staff are appropriately qualified and we carry out checks for criminal and other records through the 
[Disclosure and Barring Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service)
in accordance with statutory requirements.

# Procedures #

## Vetting and staff selection ##

* We work towards offering equality of opportunity by using non-discriminatory procedures for staff recruitment and selection, as set out in our [Equal Opportunities Policy](/policies/equal_opportunities.html).

* Staff have job descriptions which set out their roles and responsibilities.

* We welcome applications from all sections of the community. Applicants will be 
considered on the basis of their suitability for the post, regardless of marital 
status, age, gender, culture, religious belief, ethnic origin or sexual orientation. 
We will not disadvantage them by imposing unjustifiable conditions or requirements.

* Applications for employment with our pre-school must be made using our
[Job Application Form](/policies/20130809-Vacancy_Application_Form.pdf). This ensures that
we gather comprehensive background information on which to base employment decisions and makes it easier
to spot gaps or omissions in the details provided, which is an important part of our
safer recruitment procedures.

* We use 
[Ofsted guidance](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/factsheet-childcare-disclosure-and-barring-service-dbs-checks-for-those-providers-who-register-ofste) 
on obtaining references and enhanced criminal record checks through the 
[Disclosure and Barring Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service)
for staff and volunteers who will have unsupervised access to children. 

* We keep records relating to employment of staff and volunteers, in particular those demonstrating 
that checks have been done. This includes the date and number of the enhanced Disclosure 
and Barring Service check, who obtained it and who reviewed the outcome. We also record who obtained
and who reviewed references. In line with the code-of-practice for
[handling of DBS certificate information](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/handling-of-dbs-certificate-information)
and [guidance for employers](https://www.gov.uk/dbs-check-requests-guidance-for-employers),
we securely dispose of the certificates and references once they have been reviewed.

* Staff are expected to disclose any convictions, cautions, court orders, reprimands 
and warnings which may affect their suitability to work with children,
whether received before or during their employment with us.

* At least two references will be taken prior to any job offer.


## Disqualification ##

* Where we become aware of any relevant information which may lead to the disqualification of an employee,
we will take appropriate action to ensure the safety of children.

* In the event of disqualification, that person's employment with us will be terminated.

## Changes to staff ##

* We inform Ofsted of any changes in the manager responsible for our setting or of the trustees.

## Training and staff development ##

* Our setting leader and deputy hold the [CACHE Level 3 Diploma in Pre-school Practice](http://www.cache.org.uk/Qualifications/CYP/CYPL3/Pages/CACHE-Level-3-Diploma-in-Pre-school-Practice-(NQF).aspx)
or an equivalent or higher qualification.

* A minimum of half of our staff hold the [CACHE Level 2 Certificate in Pre-school Practice](http://www.cache.org.uk/Qualifications/CYP/CYPL2/Pages/CACHE-Level-2-Certificate-in-Pre-school-Practice.aspx)
or an equivalent or higher qualification.

* We provide regular in-service training to all staff, trustees and volunteers.

* Our setting budget allocates resources to training.

* We provide staff induction training in the first weeks of employment. This induction includes our 
[Health and Safety Policy](/policies/health_and_safety.html) and 
[Safeguarding Children and Child Protection Policy](/policies/safeguarding_children.html). 
Other policies and procedures are introduced as part of the induction process.

* We support the work of our staff by holding regular supervision meetings and appraisals.

* We are committed to recruiting, appointing and employing staff in accordance with all relevant legislation and best practice.


## Staff taking medication or other substances ##

* If a member of staff is taking medication which may affect their ability to care for children, we ensure that they seek further medical advice.

* Staff will only work directly with the children if medical advice confirms that their medication is unlikely to impair their ability to look after children properly.

* Staff medication on the premises will be stored securely and kept out of reach of the children at all times.

* If we have reason to believe that a member of staff is under the influence of alcohol 
or any other substance that may affect their ability to care for children they will not be 
allowed to work directly with the children and our [Disciplinary Procedure](/policies/disciplinary.html) will be followed.
 

## Staff absence ##

* Our staff take their holiday breaks when the setting is closed.

* Where staff may need to take time off for any reason other than sick leave or training, this is agreed with the manager with sufficient notice.

* Where staff are unwell and take sick leave in accordance with their contract of employment, we organise cover to ensure ratios are maintained.

* Sick leave is monitored and action is taken where necessary in accordance with their contract of employment.

* As contingency to cover staff absences, we will call upon the following:
    * [Trustees](/trustees/)
    * Parent Volunteers
    * Agency Staff

* The pre-school will not open unless there are sufficient personnel in the setting to ensure that minumum ratios are met.
