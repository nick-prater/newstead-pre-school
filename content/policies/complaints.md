# Statement of Intent #

Newstead Road Pre-School believes that children, parents and carers are entitled to expect courtesy and prompt, careful attention to their needs and wishes.

We welcome suggestions on how to improve and will give prompt and serious attention to any concerns about the the running of the setting, including the way a child is being treated or any actions, or lack of action by us.

We anticipate that most concerns will be resolved quickly, by an informal approach to the appropriate member of staff, but if this does not achieve the desired result, we have a procedure for dealing with concerns which is detailed below.

We aim to bring all concerns about Newstead Road Pre-School to a satisfactory conclusion for all parties involved.

# Procedures #
Our complaints procedure has a number of stages, described below. At each stage, the complaint may be resolved, in which case later stages are not pursued.

All pre-schools are required to keep a written record of any complaints that reach Stage 2 and above. This record must include the date, the circumstances of the complaint, the outcome and how the complaint was managed. It must be made available to parents and Ofsted inspectors on request.

A full procedure is set out in the Pre-school Learning Alliance publication [Complaint Investigation Record](https://shop.pre-school.org.uk/A103) which acts as the _summary log_ for record-keeping purpose.

# Making a complaint #

## Stage 1 ##
* Any person who has a concern about an aspect of the pre-school talks over their concerns with the setting manager.

* Most complaints should be resolved amicably and informally at this stage.

## Stage 2 ##
* If Stage 1 does not have a satisfactory outcome, or if the problem recurs, the complainant should put their concerns in writing to the Pre-School Manager and the chair of the management committee, who will investigate the complaint.

* For those not comfortable with making written complaints, there is a [template form](/policies/Formal_Complaint_Form.pdf) for recording complaints. The form may be completed with help from the pre-school manager, then signed by the person making the complaint.

* The setting stores written complaints from parents and carers in their child's personal file. However, if the complaint involves a detailed investigation, the Pre-school manager may wish to store all information relating to the investigation in a separate file designated for this complaint.

* When the investigation into the complaint is completed, the Pre-school manager meets with the complainant to discuss the outcome.

* The complainant must be informed of the outcome of the investigation within 28 days of making the complaint.

* When the complaint is resolved at this stage, the summative points are logged in the _Complaint Investigation Record_.

## Stage 3 ##
* If the complainant is not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation, they request a meeting with the Pre-school manager and the chair of the management committee. The complainant may have a friend or partner present if they wish. The Pre-school manager should have the support of the chair of the management committee.

* An agreed written record of the discussion is made and any decision or action to be take as a result. All of those present at the meeting sign the record and receive a copy of it.

* The signed record signifies that the procedure has concluded. When the complaint is resolved at this stage, the summative points are logged in the _Complaints Summary Record_.

## Stage 4 ##
* If at the Stage 3 meeting the complainant and Pre-school cannot reach agreement, an external mediator is invited to help to settle the complaint. This person should be acceptable to both parties, listen to both sides and offer advice. A mediator has no legal powers but can help to define the problem, review the action so far and suggest further ways in which it might be resolved.

* The mediator keeps all discussion confidential. They can hold separate meetings with the Pre-school personnel and the complainant. The mediator keeps an agreed written record of any meetings that are held and of any advice given.

## Stage 5 ##
* When the mediator has concluded their investigations, a final meeting between the complainant, the Pre-school manager and the chair of the management committee is held.
The purpose of this meeting is to reach a decision on the action to be taken to deal with the complaint. The mediator's advice is used to reach this conclusion. The mediator is present at the meeting if all parties think this will help a decision to be reached.

* A record of this meeting, including the decision on the action to be taken, is made. Everyone present at the meeting signs the record and receives a copy of it. This signed record signifies that the procedure has concluded.

# The role of the Ofsted and the Local Safeguarding Children Board #

* Those wishing to make a complaint may [approach Ofsted directly](https://www.ofsted.gov.uk/onlinecomplaints) at 
any stage of this complaints procedure. In addition, where there seems to be a possible breach of our registration 
requirements, it is essential to involve [Ofsted](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/) as the registering and 
inspection body with a duty to ensure the Safeguarding and Welfare Requiremens of the Early Years Foundation Stage are adhered to.

* Details of how to contact Ofsted are displayed on the pre-school's notice board.
