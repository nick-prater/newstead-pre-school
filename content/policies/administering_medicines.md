# Policy Statement #
While it is not our policy to care for sick children, who should be at home until they are well enough to return to the setting, we will agree to administer medication as part of maintaining their health and well-being, or when they are recovering from an illness.

In many cases, it is possible for children’s GPs to prescribe medicine that can be taken at home in the morning and evening. Medicines will only be administered in the setting where it would be detrimental to the child’s health not to do so.

Each key person is responsible for the correct administration of medication to children for whom 
they are the key person. This includes ensuring that:

1. [consent forms](/policies/Administering_Medicines_Consent_Form.pdf) have been completed by the parent or carer
2. medicines are stored correctly
3. records are kept in accordance with procedures detailed below

In the absence of the key person, the manager is responsible 
for the overseeing of administering medication.

# Procedures #

* Children taking prescribed medication must be well enough to attend the setting.

* Only medication prescribed by a doctor, or other medically qualified person, is administered. It must be in-date and prescribed for the current condition. Medicines containing aspirin will only be given if prescribed by a doctor.

* Medicines are stored in their original containers, in a place which is inaccessible to children and are clearly labelled.

## Consent ##
* Parents or carers give prior written permission for the administration of medication. The staff 
receiving the medication must ask them to sign a [consent form](/policies/Administering_Medicines_Consent_Form.pdf),
stating the following information:

    * the full name of their child and their date of birth
    * the name of the medication and its strength
    * who prescribed the medication
    * the dosage to be given in the setting
    * how the medication should be stored
    * the medicine's expiry date
    * any side effects that may be expected
    * the signature of the parent or carer, alongside their printed name and the date

* The child's key worker (or in their absence the pre-school manager) will receive the child’s medication, ensure that a consent form is completed and that other staff are made aware.

* Without this consent, no medication may be given.

* The person receiving the consent form will ensure a copy of it is placed in the child's file.

* In the case of life-saving or invasive treatments, such as adrenaline injections for anaphylactic shock 
or rectal administration of Diazepam for prolonged seizures, or in the case of children requiring assistance with 
tubes to help them with everyday living, the pre-school's insurer must be consulted and provided with the following:

    * A letter from the child's GP or consultant stating the child's condition and what medication, if any, is to be administered.
    * Written consent from the parent or carer allowing staff to administer the medication.
    * Proof of training in the administration of such medication.

## Administration of Medicine ##
* The administration of medicine is recorded accurately in our medication record book each time 
it is given. The book is signed by the key person or pre-school manager. The child's parent or carer is 
shown the record at the end of the session and asked to sign the record book to acknowledge 
the administration of the medicine. The medication record book records the:

    * name of the child
    * name and strength of the medication
    * date and time of the dose
    * dose given and method
    * signature of the key person or pre-school manager
    * parent or carer's signature

* If the administration of prescribed medication requires medical knowledge, individual training is provided for the relevant member of staff by a health professional. A number of staff have been trained in the use of [EpiPen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector) (an adrenaline pen which can be lifesaving in people who experience severe allergic reactions) and their certificates are displayed in the pre-school hallway.

* If rectal diazepam is administered (a treatment for prolonged seizures), this must be in accordance with that child's individual treatment protocol, as decided by a doctor. Another member of staff must be present who will co-sign the record book.

* No child may self-administer medication. Where children are capable of understanding when they need medication, for example with asthma, they should be encouraged to tell their key person what they need. However, this does not replace staff vigilance in knowing and responding when a child requires medication.

* We use the Pre-school Learning Alliance’s [Medication Administration Record book](https://shop.pre-school.org.uk/A094) for recording the administration of medicine and comply with the detailed procedures set out in that publication.

## Storage of medicines ##
* All medication is stored safely in a locked cupboard or refrigerated as required. Where the cupboard or refrigerator is not used solely for storing medicines, they are kept in a marked plastic box.

* The child’s key person is responsible for ensuring medicine is handed back at the end of the day to the parent.

* For some conditions, medication may be kept in the setting to be administered on a regular or as-and-when-required basis. Key persons check that any medication held in the setting is in date and return any out-of-date medication back to the parent.

* Medicines are kept in the kitchen, in a labelled plastic box, out-of-reach of children on a shelf next to the first-aid box. If medicines need to be kept refrigerated, they are stored in a labelled and sealed plastic box in the kitchen fridge. Staff, volunteers and students are informed of their location during their induction.

## Children who have long term medical conditions and who may require ongoing medication ##
* A risk assessment is carried out for each child with long term medical conditions that require ongoing medication. This is the responsibility of the manager alongside the key person. Other medical or social care personnel may need to be involved in the risk assessment.

* Parents will also contribute to a risk assessment. They should be shown around the setting, understand the routines and activities and point out anything which they think may be a risk factor for their child.

* For some medical conditions, key staff will need to have training in a basic understanding of the condition, as well as how the medication is to be administered correctly. The training needs for staff form part of the risk assessment.

* The risk assessment includes vigorous activities and any other activity that may give cause for concern regarding an individual child’s health needs.

* The risk assessment includes arrangements for taking medicines on outings and advice is sought from the child’s GP if necessary where there are concerns.

* A [health care plan](/policies/Health_Care_Plan_Form.pdf) for the child is drawn up with the parent; outlining the key person’s role and what information must be shared with other staff who care for the child.

* The [health care plan](/policies/Health_Care_Plan_Form.pdf) should include the measures to be taken in an emergency.

* The [health care plan](/policies/Health_Care_Plan_Form.pdf) is reviewed every six months, or more frequently if necessary. This includes reviewing the medication, e.g. changes to the medication or the dosage, any side effects noted etc.

* Parents receive a copy of the [health care plan](/policies/Health_Care_Plan_Form.pdf) and each contributor, including the parent, signs it.

## Managing medicines on trips and outings ##
* If children are going on outings, staff accompanying the children must include the key person for each child with a risk assessment, or another member of staff who is fully informed about the child’s needs and/or medication.

* Medication for a child is taken in a sealed plastic box clearly labelled with the child’s name and the name of the medication. Inside the box is a copy of the consent form and a card to record when it has been given, including all the details that need to be recorded in the medication record as stated above.

* On returning to the setting the card is stapled to the medicine record book and the parent signs it.

* If a child on medication has to be taken to hospital, the child’s medication is taken in a sealed plastic box clearly labelled with the child’s name and the name of the medication. Inside the box is a copy of the consent form signed by the parent.

* In the context of trips or outings, this procedure is read alongside the outings procedure.
