# Policy Statement #
We will ensure that our service is fully inclusive in meeting the needs of all children. 

We recognise that children and their families come from diverse backgrounds.

All families have needs and values that arise
from their social, economic, ethnic, cultural or religious backgrounds. Children grow up in diverse
family structures that include two-parent and one-parent families. Some children have two parents of the
same sex. Some children have close links with extended families of grandparents, aunts, uncles and
cousins. Others may be more removed from close kin or may live with other relatives or foster
carers. Some children have needs that arise from disability or impairment, or may have parents that are
affected by disability or impairment.

Some children come from families who experience social exclusion or severe hardship; some have to
face discrimination and prejudice because of their ethnicity, the languages they speak, their religious or
belief background, their gender or their impairment.

We understand that these factors affect the well-being of children and can impact on their learning and
attainment. Our setting is committed to anti-discriminatory practice to promote equality of opportunity and valuing
diversity for all children and families. We aim to:

* provide a secure and accessible environment in which all our children can flourish and in which all
contributions are considered and valued.
* include and value the contribution of all families to our understanding of equality and diversity.
* provide positive non-stereotyping information about gender roles and diverse family structures,
diverse ethnic and cultural groups and disabled people.
* improve our knowledge and understanding of issues of anti-discriminatory practice, promoting
equality and valuing diversity.
* challenge and eliminate discriminatory actions.
* make inclusion a thread that runs through all of the activities of the setting.
* foster good relations between all communities.

# Procedures #

## Admissions ##

Our setting is open to all members of the community.

* We advertise our service widely.

* We reflect the diversity of our society in our publicity and promotional materials.

* We provide information in clear, concise language, whether in spoken or written form.

* We provide information in as many languages as possible.

* We base our admissions policy on a fair system.

* We ensure that parents and carers are made aware of this equal opportunities policy.

* We do not discriminate against a child or their family, or prevent entry to our setting, on the basis of a
protected characteristic as defined by the [Equality Act 2010](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents). These are:

    * disability
    * race
    * gender reassignment
    * religion or belief
    * sex
    * sexual orientation
    * age
    * pregnancy and maternity
    * marriage and civil partnership

* We develop an action plan to ensure that people with impairments can participate successfully in the
services offered by the setting and in the curriculum offered.

* We take action against any discriminatory behaviour by staff or parents whether by:

    * _direct discrimination_ – someone is treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic
e.g. preventing families of some racial groups from using the service.
    * _indirect discrimination_ - someone is affected unfavourably by a general policy e.g. children must
only speak English in the setting.
    * _association_ – discriminating against someone who is associated with a person with a protected
characteristic e.g. behaving unfavourably to someone who is married to a person from a different
cultural background.
    * _perception_ – discrimination on the basis that it is thought someone has a protected characteristic
e.g. assuming someone is gay because of their mannerism or how they speak.

* Displaying of openly discriminatory and possibly offensive materials, name calling, or threatening
behaviour are unacceptable on or around the premises and will be dealt with in the strongest
manner.

## Employment ##
* Posts are advertised and all applicants are judged against explicit and fair criteria.

* Applicants are welcome from all backgrounds and posts are open to all.

* The applicant who best meets the criteria for a vacancy is offered the post, subject to references and checks by the
[Disclosure and Barring Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service).
This ensures fairness in the selection process.

* All job descriptions include a commitment to promoting equality and recognising and respecting
diversity as part of their specifications.

## Training ##
* We seek out training opportunities for staff and volunteers to enable them to develop anti-
discriminatory and inclusive practices, which enable all children to flourish.

* We ensure that staff are confident and fully trained in administering relevant medicines and
performing appropriate care procedures when these are required.

* We review our practices to ensure that we are fully implementing our policy for promoting equality,
valuing diversity and inclusion.

## Curriculum ##
The curriculum offered by our setting encourages children to develop positive attitudes about themselves
and people who are different from themselves. It encourages children to empathise with others
and to begin to develop the skills of critical thinking.

Our environment is as accessible as possible for all visitors and service users. If access to the settings is
found to treat disabled children or adults less favourably then we make reasonable adjustments to
accommodate the needs of disabled children and adults. We do this by:

* Making children feel valued and good about themselves and others.

* Ensuring that children have equality of access to learning.

* Undertaking an access audit to establish if the setting is accessible to all children.

* Making adjustments to the environment and resources to accommodate a wide range of learning, physical and sensory impairments.

* Making appropriate provision within the curriculum to ensure each child receives the widest possible
opportunity to develop their skills and abilities, e.g. recognising the different learning styles of girls and boys.

* Positively reflecting the widest possible range of communities in our choice of resources.

* Avoiding stereotypes or derogatory images in the selection of books or other visual materials.

* Celebrating a wide range of festivals.

* Creating an environment of mutual respect and tolerance.

* Differentiating the curriculum to meet children’s special educational needs.

* Helping children to understand that discriminatory behaviour and remarks are hurtful and
unacceptable.

* Ensuring that the curriculum offered is inclusive of children with special educational needs and
children with disabilities.

* Ensuring that children learning English as an additional language have full access to the curriculum
and are supported in their learning.

* Ensuring that children speaking languages other than English are supported in the maintenance and
development of their home languages.

## Valuing diversity in families ##

* We welcome the diversity of family lifestyles and work with all families.

* We encourage children to contribute stories of their everyday life to the setting.

* We encourage mothers, fathers and other carers to take part in the life of the setting and to
contribute fully.

* For families who speak languages in addition to English, we will develop means to ensure their full
inclusion.

* We offer a flexible payment system for families of differing means and offer information regarding
sources of financial support.

* We take positive action to encourage disadvantaged and under-represented groups to use the
setting.

## Food ##
* We work in partnership with parents to ensure that dietary requirements of children that arise from
their medical, religious or cultural needs are met.

* We help children to learn about a range of food, and of cultural approaches to mealtimes and eating,
and to respect the differences among them.

## Meetings ##
* Meetings are arranged to ensure that all families who wish to may be involved in the running of the
pre-school.

* We positively encourage fathers to be involved in the setting especially those fathers who do not live
with the child.

* Information about meetings is communicated in a variety of ways: written, verbal and, upon request, in translation,
to ensure that all mothers and fathers have information about and access to the meetings.
