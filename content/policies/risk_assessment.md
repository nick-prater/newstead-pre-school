# Policy statement #
Our setting believes that the health and safety of children is of paramount importance. We make our setting a
safe and healthy place for children, parents, carers, staff and volunteers by assessing and minimising the hazards and
risks to enable the children to thrive in a healthy and safe environment.

This policy is based on the Pre-school Learning Alliance risk assessment processes, which follow
the five steps listed below:

1. Identification of risk: Where is it and what is it?

2. Who is at risk? (staff, children, parents, carers, cleaners...)

3. Assessment as to whether the level of risk is high, medium, low, taking into account both its
likelihood and its possible impact.

4. Control measures to reduce/eliminate risk: What will you need to do, or ensure others will do, in order to reduce that risk?

5. Monitoring and review: How do you know if what you have said is working, or is thorough enough? If it is
not working, it will need to be amended, or maybe there is a better solution?

# Procedures #
* Our risk assessment process covers adults and children and includes:

    * Determining where it is helpful to make specific written risk assessments in relation to particular issues, to
inform staff practice, and to demonstrate how the setting is managing risks if asked by parents, carers or inspectors.

   * Checking for and noting hazards and risks indoors and outside, in relation to our premises and activities.

    * Checking for and noting hazards and risks in relation to substances that may be hazardous to health
(such as cleaning or gardening chemicals) and where they are stored, in accordance with 
[COSHH regulations](http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/index.htm).

    * Assessing the level of risk and who might be affected.

    * Deciding which areas need attention.

    * Developing and recording a plan that specifies any actions required, the time-scales for action, the person
responsible for the action and any funding required.

    * Recording any action taken following a review or incident.
 
    * Ensuring that we have instructions on what to do if any hazardous materials are spilt, ingested, 
or come into contact with eyes or skin. This information is often printed on the container, but otherwise
[Chemical Safety Data Sheets](http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh/basics/datasheets.htm) will be obtained from
the supplier.

* The pre-school manager is responsible for ensuring that the overall risk assessment is written and reviewed. A written record of the risk assessment is [required by law](http://www.hse.gov.uk/risk/faq.htm#q7) as we employ more than 5 staff and volunteers.

* We maintain lists of health and safety issues, some which are checked daily before the session begins and others
which are checked on a weekly and termly basis.

* The risk assessment process is reviewed and updated at least once every year.
