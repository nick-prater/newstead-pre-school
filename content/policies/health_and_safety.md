# Policy statement #
Newstead Road Pre-School believes that the health and safety of children is of paramount importance.
We make our setting a safe and healthy place for children, parents, staff and volunteers.

* We aim to make children, parents and staff aware of health and safety issues and to minimise hazards and risks to enable the children to thrive in a healthy and safe environment.

* The member of staff responsible for health and safety is [Debbie Griffin](/staff/debbie_griffin.html), who is competent to carry out these responsibilities.

* [Debbie](/staff/debbie_griffin.html) has undertaken health and safety training and regularly updates her knowledge and understanding.

* We display a [health and safety law poster](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/lawposter.htm) in the kitchen of the pre-school, where it is visible to all staff and volunteers.

# Insurance cover #
We have public liability insurance and employers’ liability insurance, the certificates for which are displayed on the noticeboard in the pre-school hallway.

# Procedures #

## Awareness raising ##

* Our induction training for staff and volunteers includes a clear explanation of health and safety issues so that they 
are able to adhere to our policy and procedures and understand their shared responsibility 
for health and safety.  The induction training covers matters of employee well-being, 
including safe lifting and the storage of potentially dangerous substances.

* Health and safety matters are included in the welcome pack given to parents of new children, so that they understand the part played by these issues in the daily life of the setting.

* Health and safety is discussed at staff meetings.

* Health and safety matters are included in staff training and professional development plans.

* We operate a [no smoking policy](/policies/smoking.html).

* Children are made aware of health and safety issues through discussions, planned activities and routines.


## Safety of adults ##

* Adults are provided with guidance about the safe storage, movement, lifting and erection of large 
pieces of equipment. They ask for help from a colleague when necessary.

* When adults need to reach up, for example to store equipment or test smoke alarms, they 
will use safe equipment to do so, which the pre-school provides.

* Warning signs are clear.

* Adults are not expected to remain in the building on their own, or leave the building alone after dark.

* The sickness of staff and their involvement in accidents is recorded. The records are reviewed termly 
to identify any issues that need to be addressed.

* Any substances hazardous to health, such as cleaning materials or garden chemicals are kept in locked storage, in their original containers and
considered in accordance with our [Risk Assessment Policy](/policies/risk_assessment.html).


## Doors ##

* We take precautions to prevent children's fingers from being trapped in doors, for example by ensuring they are wedged open or locked shut.


## Floors ##

* All floor surfaces are checked daily to ensure they are clean, dry and do not present a trip hazard.


## Gas and electrical equipment ##

* All electrical and gas equipment conforms to safety requirements and is checked regularly.

* Our boiler, electrical switch gear and meter cupboards are not accessible to the children.

* Radiators are enclosed within guards to minimise the risk of burns.

* Children are taught not to touch electric sockets, wires and leads.

* Gas appliances are serviced and tested annually to ensure they remain safe to use.

* The temperature of hot water is controlled to prevent scalds.

* Lighting and ventilation is adequate in all areas including storage areas.

* Electrical checks take place yearly on electrical appliances and every five years on fixed wiring. Staff are 
alert to signs of damage in-between scheduled tests and will take steps to ensure unsafe equipment is not used.


## Storage ##

* All resources and materials are stored safely, in such a way as to prevent them accidentally falling or collapsing.


## Outdoor area ##

* Our outdoor area is securely fenced.

* Our outdoor area is checked for safety and cleared of rubbish before it is used.

* Where water can form a pool on equipment, it is emptied before children start playing outside.

to ensure that we keep up-to-date with the latest recommendations.

* Our daily routines encourage the children to learn about personal hygiene.

* At least once every term, we have a deep cleaning routine for resources and equipment, dressing-up clothes and furnishings.

* The toilet area has a high standard of hygiene including hand washing and drying facilities and the disposal of nappies.

* We implement good hygiene practices by:
    * cleaning tables between activities
    * cleaning and checking toilets regularly
    * wearing protective clothing, such as disposable gloves, as appropriate
    * providing sets of clean clothes
    * providing tissues and wipes.
