title: Development and Improvement
---
We continually look for ways to improve what we do, by listening to feedback and reflecting on our 
work. In particular we welcome feedback from parents, carers, staff and the children we care for, which 
we use to shape investment in our staff, premises and resources.

There is a suggestion box just inside the entrance to the pre-school, for any ideas or feedback - good or bad -
which you may have. 

Some of the changes and improvements we have made are listed below.


September 2015 - New staff and apprentice

: As the new academic year starts, we have recruited a new apprentice, [Jodi Cast](/staff/jodi_cast.html) who will be 
working with us across every session while studying for a Level-2 qualification. We also welcome [Chloe Rich](/staff/chloe_rich.html)
to work with us in the afternoons. Chloe has a Level-3 qualification and joins us on a one-year temporary contract. The changes
help us to bring increased consistency to the afternoon staffing, further strengthening bonds between staff and children.


August 2015 - Door Finger Guards installed

: To minimise the risk of injuries from fingers being trapped in doors, we have fitted [Finger Wizard](http://norsound.com/finger-wizard) 
hinge guards to doors at the pre-school. We've thankfully not suffered any such injuries in the past, but identified the potential
for injury as part of our annual risk assessment review.


August 2015 - Washing Machine Installed

: We have installed a washer/dryer at the pre-school, kindly donated by one of our [trustees](/trustees/), Barbara Maggs. 
The washing machine will allow us to clean towels, dressing-up costumes and uniforms without depending on parents and staff
to take laundry home.


August 2015 - Back Room and lobby decorated

: The back play room and the front lobby have been decorated, so that they are fresh for the start of the new
academic year. Next on the list: hallway, kitchen, toilets and office... Can you help?


April 2015 - 5-Star Food Hygiene Score Awarded

: Following an unannounced inspection by the London Borough of Lewisham, we were awarded a 
[Food Hygiene Rating of 5 (Very Good)](http://www.scoresonthedoors.org.uk/business/newstead-road-pre-school-london-362340.html).
This is an improvement on our previous score thanks to changes made by parents and carers
in the way packed lunches are prepared, avoiding high-risk foods and including ice packs to keep things cool. 
Our [Welcome Packs](/welcome_pack/) now includes advice and guidance on this.


December 2014 - Dishwasher purchased

: We have purchased a dishwasher which has been installed in kitchen, allowing staff to spend more time with
the children and less time washing the cups and plates!


November 2014 - Yard lights replaced

: As the nights are drawing in, it's getting dark by the end of our afternoon sessions. The faulty lighting in
the back yard and alleyway have been replaced by modern LED floodlights, controlled by a light and movemement sensor.
This will make it easier to see while tidying away and improve security at the pre-school.


October 2014 - Boiler Service

: [AC Wilgar](http://www.acwilgar.co.uk/) have done a fine job of servicing our boiler. After our first appointment
was delayed and subsequently cancelled (not good) they completed the service for free as a donation to our charity (fantastic!).
Professional, dependable service as we have come to expect. Thank you Steve Gill! Thoroughly recommended.


October 2014 - Coffee Morning

: A big thank you to all parents and carers who joined together for our first coffee morning of the school year.
Especially big thanks to those who helped run the event and bake cakes for us to eat - 
parents Maria, Marzena and Rodrigo we couldn't have run the event without you!


September 2014 - Outdoor Area

: Staff and trustees have worked to begin improvements to the pre-school's outdoor space. A superb mural
has been created of a tree and a large caterpillar. Play bark has been layed beneath the bench, covering
what was formerly dry baked mud. This provides added colour, texture and interest for the children. With the help
of parents, we hope to continue this development, perhaps with further mural painting or building a sandpit.


September 2014 - Now open four afternoons per week

: To cater for increased demand for places and to make better use of our facilities, we are now open Monday-Thursday
afternoons during term time, in adddition to our usual Monday-Friday morning sessions.


September 2014 - Lockers for Staff

: We have invested in a set of lockers for so that staff can safely store their bags and personal belongings while
at work. Previously they were being left on the floor or crammed into a single small locker in the kitchen,
which was identified as a risk to safety and security.


August 2014 - New lease in place

: After nearly two years of negotiation and bureaucracy, we now have a new five-year protected tenancy 
lease in place. The new
lease gives us sole occupancy of the pre-school premises and the ability to hire rooms out for other events and
functions, allowing us to develop the pre-school as a community resource. Unfortunately there is a significant 
increase in the rent we have to pay, but we have allowed for this in our budgeting.


July 2014 - Pre-school Farm Outing

: We packed a coach and several private cars for a pre-school trip to [Godstone Farm](http://godstonefarm.co.uk/)
for our summer outing.


May 2014 - New member of staff - Emma Turay

: Emma has joined us on a temporary contract to provide cover while Louretta is absent. Emma is well qualified
and has experience of working in a number of early years settings. She has quickly become part of our pre-school
team and is forming good bonds with our children.


March 2014 - New member of staff - Sandra Meloni

: Sandra has joined us to assist during the busy lunchtime period and during our increasingly popular
afternoon sessions. She has been a parent volunteer with us for many years, all of her children having
attended our setting. Sandra will be studying for a Level-2 early years qualification.


February 2014 - New Committee Member

: Chrissy Davison, Madison's mum has joined our trustees committee, who oversee the
administration of the pre-school. She takes over from Loretta Perry
who has now moved to New Zealand!


February 2014 - New member of staff - Sarah Crow

: Sarah Crow has joined us to provide maternity cover for Leah. She is highly qualified to
foundation degree level and is familiar with
our pre-school, having previously covered Eve's study leave.


January 2014 - New changing table

: New changing table from 
[Community Playthings](http://www.communityplaythings.co.uk/products/baby-room/changing-tables) 
purchased and installed. It arrived in an enormous cardboard box which has inspired numerous 
creative activities as the children transform it into a castle!


January 2014 - Job Descriptions reviewed and updated for all staff

: Over time roles and responsibilities within our pre-school evolve
and skills develop. During the past few months we have reviewed 
and refreshed all staff job descriptions. We recognise that the
quality of our provision depends on all members of staff having a clear understanding
of their roles and responsibilities. Accurate job descriptions help to 
communicate this and complement regular appraisals. This in turn helps ensure
that training needs are identified and met. (See the 
EYFS Statutory Framework 2012,
section 3.18.)


January 2014 - New sign on front door

: A smart new [sign](/Front_Door_Sign-20131223-3.pdf) has been 
installed on the front door of the pre-school, showing
up-to-date opening hours, logo and contact details. It highlights that we are
able to offer free sessions for all children from the age of 3 and some eligible
2-year-olds. The sign was designed using the
free graphics editor [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) and manufactured for us
by [TTC Signs](http://www.ttcsigns.co.uk). We hope you like it!


December 2013 - Annual fire extinguisher service completed

: All fire extinguishers were inspected and found to be in good order by [Delta Fire Systems](http://www.deltafiresystems.co.uk/).

November 2013 - Subscription to [Nursery World](http://www.nurseryworld.co.uk/) Magazine

: We have subscribed to [Nursery World](http://www.nurseryworld.co.uk/) magazine
to help staff to keep up-to-date with developments and best practice in early years
work and to provide additional resources for activities within our setting. The
subscription includes a monthly printed magazine and online access to a wealth of
articles on early years matters.


November 2013 - Recruitment of new apprentice

: We have recruited a second apprentice, [Alex Mwanza](/staff/alex_mwanza.html). This will improve staff
ratios, allowing more small-group working with children and providing more opportunity for staff to
engage in training, professional development, planning and observations. Our July 2013 parent survey
showed that parents wished for us to recruit a male member of staff, to provide a male role model,
something which remains rare in early years education. We apply a policy of equal opportunites
in all that we do, but are pleased that we have been able to address this feedback.


November 2013 - Improving Observation and Recording of Child Development

: We have identified the need to improve our observation and recording of child development. All staff
have been provided with further training on observations by LEARN. We have recognised the need to implement
cohort tracking across different groupings, in addition to the existing development tracking of individual children.
We are evaluating the [Tapestry](http://eyfs.info/tapestry-info/introduction) software system to improve
the way we gather observations, the way we share them with parents/carers and to allow us to quickly recognise
and address any gaps or weaknesses in our observtions, planning or practice.


November 2013 - Improved lighting at the front of the building

: Now that we are open afternoons and the winter evenings are drawing in, it will be dark when staff leave the pre-school.
This issue was identified as part of our insurance risk assessment in September 2013. We have replaced the faulty
lighting by the pre-school's front door with improved LED lighting. At the same time, Lewisham Council have installed
improved street lighting outside, which will be connected shortly.


October 2013 - Strengthening key-worker bonds

: We operate a [Key Person System](/policies/key_person.html) to champion the individual needs of each child
in our care, however children can play and work in different groups depending on their interests and the
different activities planned each day. As a small setting, with consistent staffing, children benefit by 
forming bonds with each of the staff, however we identified a need to increase the time spent as a key-worker
group. Each child now sits with their key-worker at lunch time, providing an extra opportunity to interact,
form relationships and share information.


October 2013 - Encouraging independence at lunch time

: We reviewed the way lunch was organised and realised that we could offer more opportunities for independence
by the children. Rather than serving children with drinks, we now encourage them to fetch and pour their own drink
and to assist with the preparation and clearing away.


October 2013 - Improved access to outdoor space and coats for staff

: Spending time outdoors is an important part of each day at Newstead Road Pre-School, but until now 
we have not had the outdoor space open at the start of the day. We have trialled, with great success,
opening our outdoor space from the beginning, so that children can choose to leave their coats on
and begin play outside from the beginning of the session. We find this is very popular with the children,
who are able to move to the indoor activites at a time of their choosing. This has improved learning outcomes,
children's wellbeing and behaviour throughout the session. Staff have reported that their existing
uniform fleeces are old, worn and not sufficiently warm. They have chosen smart new outdoor coats which
have been purchased for them to wear.


October 2013 - Computers and Technology

: We use computers to support many Early Years learning goals, both as part of Understanding The World and in 
relation to other areas of learning. We have a range of software programs available, however 
we identified that
some children were ready for more challenges, while our younger children would benefit from something aimed
more specifically at them. As a result, we have purchased [Rizbi](http://www.rizbi.com/home.html) and 
[Gigglebies Super Sports Day](http://gigglebies.com/supersportsday.html). [Debbie Griffin](/staff/debbie_griffin.html)
reports of the Rizbi disk: "This disc is ideal for the very young 
children and those that have difficulty learning how to use the mouse (one 
of my keychildren who previously has had trouble using the mouse really 
enjoyed being on the computer today for an exceptionally long time).  So it 
works :)".  We also recognised that tablet computers
are a part of today's world and that there are a variety of apps available relevant to early years work.
Consequently we have purchased an [Android tablet computer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0099NPR84)
for the children to use.


September 2013 - Better provision for our wider age range and use of space

: Historically our pre-school has not accepted children younger than 2.5 years old. In September 2012 we 
began accepting children from the age of 2. Now having had a full year of experience with younger children
in our setting, we have been able to reflect on our performance. In the past we have worked 
with a ratio of 4 staff to 24 children. Given the design of our building, 
we were only able to have one of our play rooms open at any one time. This limited the space available for
activities and at times it proved challenging to provide a sufficient range or challenges from the earliest 
to the most advanced stages of development. From September 2013 we have expanded our morning sessions to have
6 staff and 30 children. We have extended the temporary contract of [Louretta Boyode](/staff/louretta_boyode.html)
and recruited a new apprentice [Sarah Wyatt](/staff/sarah_wyatt.html). 
This allows us to operate free-flow between both rooms and outdoors, addressing an Ofsted concern
that we were not making full use of our space and with the extra space, provide a wider range of activities.


September 2013 - Purchase of Steps

: As part of our insurance risk assessment reviewed in September 2013, we identified that staff were using chairs
to reach high shelves and put up displays. In consultation with [Debbie Griffin](/staff/debbie_griffin.html), our
health and safety officer, we have purchased some portable steps.


September 2013 - Temperature Regulation of Hot Water

: As part of our insurance risk assessment reviewed in September 2013, we identified that the hot water tap in the
back room and the kitchen were not thermostatically controlled like the other taps. As a result they had the potential 
to cause scalding. We have installed thermostatic controls for both taps and tested the temperature regulation for
the other sinks.


September 2013 - Interest Table

: We have introduced an interest table giving the children new things to explore that link with the 
themes being planned for each half term. Staff members will take turns to be responsible for the interest
table, with a different person taking the role every half term. Our first table included items from 
the natural world, a highlight of which was a real blackbird's nest.


August 2013 - Policies Reviewed and published online

: We reviewed our folder of policies and procedures, removing those deemed unnecessary and revising others to 
reflect changing requirements, guidance and legislation. To make them more accessible, we have published 
them online for the first time, while keeping a printed copy at the pre-school for inspection. All staff
are required to be familiar with the policies. To ensure that changes are communicated to all staff, we
have added a document control sheet to each policy, which each staff member signs to confirm that they
have read and understood the updated versions.


August 2013 - Rearrangement of Room to reflect children's interests

: We have noticed that our home corner is proving very popular, yet was cramped in the room layout. We have
reconfigured the room to reflect the interests of our children, by relocating and expanding the home corner.
This rearrangement has also allowed us to move the reading area to a more peaceful part of the room and it has
been equipped with a new rug and cushions for the children to sit on.


July 2013 - Parents help with redecoration

: Our parents survey and staff discussions highlighted a need to redecorate the pre-school. A group of 
parents volunteered and worked together with some of the staff to redecorate the main play room during the 
summer break. Staff visited other early years environments to consider which colours to use, giving 
consideration to the needs of children on the autistic spectrum. The resulting decoration has been well-received
and as a by-product relationships between the parents and staff involved have been strengthened.


July 2013 - Purchase of new Fridge/Freezer

: Our regular checks identified that the old fridge was not achieving a sufficiently low temperature for the
safe storage of food. It did not have a freezer compartment. Discussion with staff identified that having
a freezer on site would allow more creative activity planning involving ice, such as exploring hot and cold
and mixing colours. We have purchased and installed a new fridge/freezer unit.


June 2013 - Dad's Breakfast

: The majority of children attending our pre-school are brought and collected by mums or female carers. 
We're aware of the need to involve dads and male carers in the work of the setting, the development of their
children and the importance of opportunities for them to to interact and share experiences. We introduced
a dad's breakfast, for them to attend with their children before the start of the main pre-school session.
This was well attended and the feedback we received was excellent.


June 2013 - Supervision Training

: We have identified a need to improve our staff supervision and appraisal meetings, which are important
to ensure that we are doing the best we can for the children in our care. Our manager,
[Pat McGowan](/staff/pat_mcgowan.html) and deputy, [Eve Ratcliff](/staff/eve_ratcliff.html) attended a
course on supervision provided by Influential Child Care Training.


June 2013 - Letterbox installed

: It might seem obvious or trivial, but until now, the pre-school has not had a letterbox. During term-time
this means sessions were disturbed opening the door for the postman and during holidays and weekends, post 
was missed. We now have a very smart and useful letterbox in the front door. In many ways this marked a 
turning point in our ability and confidence to recongise where changes are required and to work together in
implementing them. For this writer at least, it is very symbolic!


May 2013 - Parents Evening

: In addition to the regular informal contact and discussions between parents and staff, we identified a need for
a more formal opportunity to meet and talk with parents and carers. In the 2013 summer term, we introduced
a parents evening inviting every family to vist the pre-school for an individual disussion with their child's 
key worker. The event received incredibly positive feedback from staff and families. As a result, we will
now be holding a parents evening once every term.


April 2013 - Afternoon Opening

: With morning sessions running at near full capacity, we were facing a shortage of places as children were turning
three and gaining elibigility for 15 hours funded early years education. We consulted with parents and staff, deciding
to open for three 1300-1600 afternoon sessions every week. Two additional temporary staff members were recruited 
to facilitate this, while our deputy manager [Eve Ratcliff](/staff/eve_ratcliff.html) was put in charge of the afternoon
sessions, giving her more opportunity to put her training and degree studies into pratice.


March 2013 - Installation of Broadband Internet

: We have installed broadband internet at the pre-school. This provides access to resources 
to develop and help with the activities we plan for children in our sessions. It allows 
access to Ofsted's online services and faster
completion of Disclosure and Barring Service checks. It permits more effective communication between staff,
committee, suppliers and agencies. For professional development it gives staff access to a range of online courses.
It opens the way for us to explore online planning, assessment and observation tools.
