Below we celebrate some of the events which have taken place in and around
our pre-school. Some are regular events, some just special occasions

Godstone Farm Trip - July 2014

: A whole coach full of children, parants, staff, carers and siblings, along with some
extra cars spent the day at [Godstone Farm](http://godstonefarm.co.uk/) for a fun day out.
It was new experience for many and a great chance for families to get together. Everybody
shared a picnic for lunch.

Pantomine Trip - December 2013

: Children from the pre-school, together with parents, carers and siblings
all travelled to [The Broadway Theatre](http://broadwaytheatre.org.uk/) in
Catford to see [Sleeping Beauty](http://www.paulholmanassociates.co.uk/showinfo.asp?showID=100071).
For many of our children this was a new experience - their first time in a theatre. It
was also a great opportunity for families to socialise together. By booking as a group
we were able to access specially discounted tickets.
