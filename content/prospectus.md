# We aim to... #

* provide high quality care and education for children below statutory school age
* work in partnership with parents to help children to learn and develop
* add to the life and well-being of the local community
* offer children and their parents a service that promotes equality and values diversity


# Parents and Carers #

Parents and carers are regarded as members of our setting who are encouraged and have the right to
shape and participate in our activities. 

As a community based, voluntary managed setting, we depend on the good will, help and participation
of parents and carers to keep going. Membership of the setting carries expectations on parents and carers
for their support and commitment.

Parents and carers have a right to be:

* valued
* respected
* kept informed
* consulted
* involved
* included at all levels.


# Children's development and learning #

We aim to ensure that each child:

* Is in a safe and stimulating environment.
* Is given generous care and attention, because of our ratio of qualified staff to children and volunteer parent helpers.
* Has the chance to join in with other children and adults to live, play, work and learn together.
* Is helped to progress their learning and development, by being helped to build on their existing knowledge and abilities.
* Has a personal key person who makes sure each child makes satisfying progress.
* Is in a setting that sees parents as partners in helping each child to learn and develop.
* Is in a setting in which parents help to shape the service it offers.


# The Early Years Foundation Stage #
The provision for children's development and learning is guided by the [Early Years Foundation Stage](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2).
Our provision reflects the four overarching principles of the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage.

1. **A Unique Child**: 
Every child is a unique child who is constantly learning and can be resilient, capable, confident and self assured.

2. **Positive Relationships**: 
Children learn to be strong and independent through positive relationships.

3. **Enabling Environments**: 
Children learn and develop well in enabling environments, in which their experiences respond to their individual needs and there is a strong partnership between practitioners, parents and carers.

4. **Learning and Development**:
Children develop and learn in different ways and at different rates. The framework covers the education and care of all children in early years provision including children with special educational needs and disabilities.

We include [What to Expect When](http://www.foundationyears.org.uk/files/2015/04/4Children_ParentsGuide_2015_FINAL_WEBv2.pdf) in our welcome pack, as a guide to your child's learning and development through the Early Years Foundation Stage.

# How we provide for development and learning #

Children start to learn about the world around them from the moment they are born.

The care and education offered by our setting helps children to continue to learn by providing 
them all with interesting activities that are appropriate for their age and stage of development.

## The Prime Areas of Development and Learning are: ##

* Personal, social and emotional development
* Physical development
* Communication and language

## The Specific Areas of Development and Learning are: ##

* Literacy
* Mathematics
* Understanding the world
* Expressive arts and design

For each area, the level of progress that children are expected to have reached by the end of 
the Early Years Foundation Stage is defined by the Early Learning Goals. These goals state 
what it is expected that children will know, and be able to do, by the end of the 
reception year of their education.

The [Development Matters](http://www.foundationyears.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Development-Matters-FINAL-PRINT-AMENDED.pdf) 
guidance sets out the likely stages of progress a child makes along their learning journey 
towards the Early Learning Goals. Our setting has regard to these matters when we assess children 
and plan for their learning. Our programme supports children to develop the knowledge, 
skills and understanding they need for:

### Personal, social and emotional development ###
* making relationships
* self confidence and self awareness
* managing feelings and behaviour.

### Physical development ###
* moving and handling
* health and self-care

### Communication and language ###
* listening and attention
* understanding
* speaking

### Literacy ###
* reading
* writing

### Mathematics ###
* numbers
* shape, space and measure

### Understanding the world ###
* people and communities
* the world
* technology

### Expressive arts and design ###
* exploring and using media and materials
* being imaginative


# Our approach to learning and development and assessment #

## Learning through play ##

Play helps young children to learn and develop through doing and talking, which research 
has shown to be the means by which young children learn to think.

Our setting uses the 
[Development Matters in the Early Years Foundation Stage](http://www.foundationyears.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Development-Matters-FINAL-PRINT-AMENDED.pdf)
guidance to plan and provide a range of play activities, 
which help children to make progress in each of the areas of learning and development.

In some of these activities, children decide how they will use the activity and, in others, 
an adult takes the lead in helping the children to take part in the activity. In all activities, 
information from [Development Matters in the Early Years Foundation Stage](http://www.foundationyears.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Development-Matters-FINAL-PRINT-AMENDED.pdf)
has been used to decide what equipment to provide and how to provide it.


## Characteristics of effective learning ##

We understand that all children engage with other people and their environment through the characteristics 
of effective learning that are described in the Development Matters guidance as:

* playing and exploring: _engagement_
* active learning: _motivation_
* creating and thinking critically: _thinking_

We aim to provide for the characteristics of effective learning by observing how a child is learning 
and being clear about what we can do and provide in order to support each child to remain an 
effective and motivated learner.


## Assessment ##

We assess how young children are learning and developing by observing them frequently. We use information 
that we gain from observations, as well as from photographs or videos of the children, to document their 
progress and where this may be leading them.

We believe that parents know their children best and we ask them to contribute to assessment by sharing 
information about what their children like to do at home and how they, as parents, are supporting development.

We make periodic assessment summaries of children's achievement based on our ongoing development records. 
These form part of children's records of achievement. We undertake these assessment summaries at regular 
intervals, as well as times of transition, such as when a child moves into a different group or when they go on to school.


## The progress check at age two ##

The Early Years Foundation Stage requires that we supply parents and carers with a short written summary 
of their child's development in the three prime areas of learning and development (personal, social and emotional 
development; physical development; and communication and language) when a child is aged between 24 - 36 months. 

The child's key person is responsible for completing the check using information from ongoing observational 
assessments carried out as part of our everyday practice, taking account of the views and contributions 
of parents and other professionals.


# Records of achievement #

The setting keeps a record of achievement for each child. Your child's record of achievement helps us to celebrate together her/his achievements and to work together to provide what your child needs for her/his well-being and to make progress. 

Your child's key person will work in partnership with you to keep this record. To do this you and she/he will collect information about your child's needs, activities, interests and achievements. This information will enable the key person to identify your child's stage of progress. You and the key person will then decide on how to help your child to move on to the next stage. 


# Working together for your children #

We maintain the ratio of adults to children in the setting that is set by the Safeguarding and Welfare Requirements. 
We also have volunteer parent helpers to complement these ratios. This helps us to:

* give time and attention to each child
* talk with the children about their interests and activities
* help children to experience and benefit from the activities we provide
* allow the children to explore and be adventurous in safety

The [staff](/staff/) who work at the pre-school are listed on our website, along with their relevant qualifications. 
We encourage and support staff to engage in further training and professional development. Their profiles are also included
in the welcome pack given to new parents.

Newstead Road Pre-School provides sessional care for children aged from 2&mdash;5 years old. We open five days a week between the following times:

|Day       | Morning     | Afternoon   |
|:---------|:------------|:------------|

|Tuesday   | 0900 - 1245 | 1300 - 1600 |
|Wednesday | 0900 - 1245 | 1300 - 1600 |
|Thursday  | 0900 - 1245 | 1300 - 1600 |
|Friday    | 0900 - 1245 | closed for planning and staff training |

On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, older children have the option to stay all day
between 0900 and 1600, for both morning and afternoon sessions.

We are open for 38 weeks each year.

We are closed summer holidays, Christmas holidays, Easter holidays, half-terms, 
bank holidays and [INSET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inset_day)
staff training days.


# How parents take part in the setting #

Our setting recognises parents as the first and most important educators of their children. 
The staff see themselves as partners with parents in providing care and education for their 
children. There are many ways in which parents take part in making the setting a welcoming 
and stimulating place for children and parents, such as:

* exchanging knowledge about their children's needs, activities, interests and progress with the staff
* contributing to the progress check at age two
* helping at sessions of the setting
* sharing their own special interests with the children
* helping to provide and look after the equipment and materials used in the children's play activities
* being part of the volunteer trustee management committee
* taking part in events and informal discussions about the activities and curriculum provided by the setting
* joining in community activities, in which the setting takes part
* building friendships with other parents in the setting

## The parents' rota ##

We have a dated rota which parents can sign if they would like to help at a particular session 
or sessions of the setting. This is kept on the noticeboard just inside the front door.
Helping at the session enables parents to see what the day-to-day 
life of the setting is like and to join in helping the children to get the best out of their activities.

## Joining in ##

Joining the rota is not the only means of taking part in the life of the setting. Parents can offer 
to take part in a session by sharing their own interests and skills with the children. Parents have 
visited to play music for the children, take part in cooking sessions and read books with the children.

We welcome parents to drop into the setting to see it at work or to speak with the staff.


# Key person and your child #

Our setting uses a key person approach. This means that each member of staff has a group of children 
for whom they are particularly responsible.

Your child's key person will be the person who works 
with you to make sure that the childcare we provide is right for your child's particular needs and 
interests.

When your child first starts at the setting, their key person will help your child to settle 
and throughout your child's time at the setting, will help your child to benefit from the setting's activities.


# Learning opportunities for adults #

As well as gaining childcare qualifications, our staff and volunteers take part in further training to help them 
keep up-to date with thinking about early years care and education.

The setting also keeps itself up-to-date with best practice, as a member of the 
[Pre-school Learning Alliance](https://www.pre-school.org.uk/), through [Under 5 magazine](https://www.pre-school.org.uk/providers/under-5),
[Nursery World](http://www.nurseryworld.co.uk/)
and other publications. The current copy of Under 5 and Nursery World are available for you to read.

From time to time the setting holds learning events for parents. These usually look at how adults 
can help children to learn and develop in their early years.


# The setting's timetable and routines #

Our setting believes that care and education are equally important in the experience which we offer children. 
The routines and activities that make up the day in the setting are provided in ways that:

* help each child to feel that they are a valued member of the setting
* ensure the safety of each child
* help children to gain from the social experience of being part of a group
* provide children with opportunities to learn and help them to value learning


## The session ##

We organise our sessions so that the children can choose from, and work at, a range of 
activities and, in doing so, build up their ability to select and work through a task to its 
completion.

Children are also helped and encouraged to take part in adult-led small and large group activities, 
which introduce them to new experiences and help them to gain new skills, while also helping them 
to learn to work with others.

Outdoor activities contribute to children's health, their physical development and their knowledge 
of the world around them. The children have the opportunity, and are encouraged, to take part in 
outdoor child-chosen and adult-led activities, as well as those provided in the indoor playrooms.


## Snacks and meals ##

The setting makes snacks and meals a social time at which children and adults sit and eat together.
Children attending the morning session bring a packed lunch.

During both morning and afternoon sessions, we provide children with a healthy snack, such
as fruit or vegetables. Water and milk are provided for children to drink.

Please tell us if your child has particular dietary needs.


## Clothing ##

We provide protective clothing for the children when they play with messy activities. We encourage 
children to gain the skills that help them to be independent and look after themselves. These include 
taking themselves to the toilet and taking off, and putting on, outdoor clothes. Clothing that is easy 
for them to manage will help them to do this.

We ask parents to leave a spare set of clothing with the pre-school in case of spills or accidents.


# Policies #

We have [policies and procedures](/policies/) to help us ensure that the service we provide is of a 
high quality one and that being a member of the setting is an enjoyable and beneficial experience 
for each child and parent. 

The staff, parents and trustees of the pre-school work together to adopt the policies, which are
usually reviewed annually. The review helps to make sure that the policies are relevant, up-to-date and
enabling us to provide a quality service for its members and the local community.

Printed copies of our policies and procedures are available for you to see at the setting in addition
to being available on our [website](/policies)


# Safeguarding children #

Our setting has a duty under the law to help safeguard children against suspected or actual _significant harm_. 
Our employment practices are intended to protect children from the likelihood of abuse in our setting. 
We have a [procedure for managing complaints or allegations](/policies/complaints.html) including those
[against a member of staff](policies/safeguarding_children.html).

Our way of working with children and their parents is planned to ensure we are aware of any problems 
that may emerge and can offer support to help families in difficulty, including referral to appropriate 
agencies when necessary. 


# Special needs #

As part of the setting's [policy](/policies/special_educational_needs.html) to make sure that 
its provision meets the needs of each individual child,
we take account of any special needs a child may have. The setting works to the requirements of the 
[Special educational needs and disability code of practice: 0 to 25 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25),
as updated in May 2015

Our Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator is [Pat McGowan](/staff/pat_mcgowan.html)


# The management of our setting #

A parent [trustees](/trustees/) committee, whose members are elected by the parents of the children who attend the setting, manage the setting.
The elections take place at our Annual General Meeting.

The trustees are responsible for:

* financial management of the pre-school
* employment and appraisal of staff
* reviewing and maintaining policies
* ensuring the pre-school meets the requirements of the _Early Years Register_ and the _Childcare Register_

The present trustees are all parents of children who are attending or have attended the pre-school:

* [Nick Prater](/trustees/nick_prater.html)
* Barbara Maggs
* Ruth Hollick
* Samantha Sharp
* Dave Sapsford

We would be glad to hear from any parents or carers who are interested in becoming a trustee of the pre-school.

The Annual General Meeting is open to the parents of all of the children who attend the setting. It is our 
shared forum for looking back over the previous year's activities and shaping the coming year's plan.


# Fees #

For the current fees, please ask the pre-school manager, [Pat McGowan](/staff/pat_mcgowan.html).

Fees must still be paid if children are absent for a short period of time. If your 
child has to be absent over a long period of time, talk to [Pat McGowan](/staff/pat_mcgowan.html) who is the pre-school
manager. 

For your child to keep their place at the setting, you must pay the fees, where these are not covered by free-entitlement
funding. Some 2-year-olds and all 3-4-year-olds are usually entitled to 15 hours of funded pre-school 
education for each week of term.


# Starting at our setting #

## The first days ##

We want your child to feel happy and safe with us. To make sure that this is the case, the staff will work with you 
to decide on how to help your child to settle into the setting. Our policy on the [Role of the Key Person and Settling-in](/policies/key_person.html)
is enclosed with the welcome pack. 

We hope that you and your child enjoy being members of our setting and that you find taking part in our 
activities interesting and stimulating. The staff are always ready and willing to talk with you about your ideas, views or questions.
