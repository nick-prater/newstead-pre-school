Our staff are kind, caring, experienced and highly qualified. Most have been with the pre-school
for many years, providing stability for the children in our care and helping them to form bonds.

Staff are recruited in line with our [Safeguarding Children policy](/policies/safeguarding_children.html) 
and our [Equal Opportunities policy](/policies/equal_opportunities.html), following safer recruitment
guidelines.

## Disclosure and Barring Service Checks ##
As part of our safeguarding policy,
[Disclosure and Barring Service](https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/contact-disclosure-and-barring-service)
'enhanced disclosure' checks have been carried out on all staff. A record is kept of all checks, including the
certificate number, date of issue, who requested the check and who reviewed the outcome. In line with the code-of-practice for 
[handling of DBS certificate information](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/handling-of-dbs-certificate-information)
and [guidance for employers](https://www.gov.uk/dbs-check-requests-guidance-for-employers), 
we securely dispose of the certificates and references once they have been reviewed.

In line with
[Ofsted guidance](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/factsheet-childcare-disclosure-and-barring-service-dbs-checks-for-those-providers-who-register-ofste),
we do not routinely repeat checks for staff with unbroken employment. Ofsted consider that such
[routine checks are excessive](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/schools/for-schools/safeguarding-children#SGAll_8) and may be considered
a poor use of resources.

Our manager [Pat McGowan](/staff/pat_mcgowan.html) has received a suitable person interview by Ofsted.
