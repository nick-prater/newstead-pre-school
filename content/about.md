Newstead Road Pre-School provides sessional care for children aged from 2-5. It opens <a href="/opening_hours/">five days a week</a>.

Parents and children benefit from consistent staffing, allowing a strong bond to build between staff and children.
The <a href="/staff/">staff</a> are mature, experienced and highly qualified. They deliver an atmosphere that is calm, yet welcoming and positive, so parents can have confidence that their children will be well looked after.

Children benefit from the opportunity to share activities with their peers and gain confidence in being independent 
from their main family or carers. The setting has a large variety of different play things and these are 
changed every day in order to stimulate maximum learning opportunity.
