## Free Entitlement

From the term after they turn three, all three and four-year-olds are entitled to
15 hours *free* early years education, every week during term-time. Some 2-year-olds are also
eligible.

## Fee Paying 

We charge fees for two-year-old children who are not eligible for the free entitlement and for
those children attending the pre-school for more than their free entitlement hours.

Our fees are currently £5.00 per hour.

For children paying fees, session costs are therefore as follows:

|Session   | Hours       | Cost   |
|:---------|:-----------:|:------:|
|Morning   | 3&frac34;   | £18.75 | 
|Afternoon | 3           | £15    |
|All day   | 7           | £35    |
